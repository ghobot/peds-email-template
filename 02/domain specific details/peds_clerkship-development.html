development
Why is this important?
The physical maturation and intellectual, social and motor development of the child follow predictable patterns, and provide the physician with a good indicator of the child's health and neurological function. The clinician must be familiar with normal patterns of development in order to detect deviations that might be the first sign of a medical or psychosocial problem.
Specific domain objectives:
•	Describe the four developmental domains of childhood (gross motor, fine motor, language, and social development).
•	Describe how abnormal findings on common development screening tools would suggest a diagnosis of developmental delay, including autism spectrum disorders. 
•	Describe the initial evaluation and need to refer a patient with evidence of developmental delay or abnormality. 
•	Demonstrate an ability to assess psychosocial, language, physical maturation, and motor development in pediatric patients using appropriate resources (e.g. Bellevue clinic templates, Bright Futures, the Denver Developmental Standard Test 2, MCHAT and HEADSS). Key features might include the following: 
o	Newborn/Infant –Disappearance of primitive reflexes; changes in tone and posture; cephalocaudal progression of motor milestones during the first year; stranger anxiety.
o	Toddler/child - Separation and autonomy in two to three-year olds; sequence of language development; concept of school readiness
o	Adolescent - Sequence of physical maturation (e.g. Tanner scales), cognitive development, and assessment of psychosocial and emotional development (e.g. HEADSS).
While you have met the clerkship expectations of logging ONE patient with this domain, please consider logging additional patients as needed until you feel you have mastered the objectives for this domain. 
For remaining domains, please remember that CLIPP cases may be used to substitute an encounter with a patient if needed.
