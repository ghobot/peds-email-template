Fever Without an Obvious Source
Why is this important?
Fever is a very common presenting complaint in pediatric patients. The ability to generate a differential diagnosis and formulate an assessment and plan for a patient presenting with fever without an obvious source is essential to pediatric practice.  
Specific domain objectives:
•	Obtain a focused history and physical exam and generate a differential diagnosis for a patient of different age groups presenting with fever without an obvious source. 
•	Describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management for each of the following diagnoses:
Sepsis, occult bacteremia, urinary tract infection, systemic viral infection (e.g. EBV), autoimmune diseases (e.g. JIA), malignancy (e.g. ALL)

While you have met the clerkship expectations of logging ONE patient with this domain, please consider logging additional patients as needed until you feel you have mastered the objectives for this domain. 
For remaining domains, please remember that CLIPP cases may be used to substitute an encounter with a patient if needed.
