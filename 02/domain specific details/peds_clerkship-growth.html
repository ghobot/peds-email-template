Growth

Why is this important?
Growth is a defining feature of childhood. Genetic and environmental factors influence the rate of growth and the final stature and body habitus the child attains. Regular monitoring of growth provides the clinician with one of the best indicators of the underlying health of the child.
Specific domain objectives:
•	Describe variants of normal growth in healthy children, (e.g. familial short stature and constitutional delay). 
•	Identify and describe abnormal growth patterns based on the family growth history and the child's previous growth e.g. microcephaly, macrocephaly, short stature, obesity, growth abnormalities related to specific physical findings.
•	Identify failure to thrive and overweight/obesity in a child or adolescent using BMI and other growth measures and outline the differential diagnosis and initial evaluation.
•	Demonstrate ability to assess growth including height/length, weight, and head circumference and body mass index in patient encounters using standard growth charts.

While you have met the clerkship expectations of logging ONE patient with this domain, please consider logging additional patients as needed until you feel you have mastered the objectives for this domain. 
For remaining domains, please remember that CLIPP cases may be used to substitute an encounter with a patient if needed.
