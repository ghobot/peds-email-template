Why is this important?
Neurologic symptoms are common presenting complaints in pediatric patients and potentially life-threatening. The ability to generate a differential diagnosis and formulate an assessment and plan for a patient presenting with neurologic symptoms, taking into consideration the characteristics of the patient (i.e. age) and the illness, is essential to pediatric practice.  

Specific domain objectives:
â€¢	Obtain a focused history and physical exam and generate a differential diagnosis for a patients presenting with each of the following symptoms:  
Lethargy, irritability, fussiness, headache, loss of consciousness, seizures
Describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management for each of the following diagnoses:
Meningitis, concussion, febrile seizure, brain tumor, closed head injury, tension headache
While you have met the clerkship expectations of logging ONE patient with this domain, please consider logging additional patients as needed until you feel you have mastered the objectives for this domain. 
For remaining domains, please remember that CLIPP cases may be used to substitute an encounter with a patient if needed
