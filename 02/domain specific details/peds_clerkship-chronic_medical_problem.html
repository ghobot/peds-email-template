chronic medical problem
Why is this important?
Pediatricians are more frequently being asked to care for children with chronic medical conditions and exacerbations of their chronic illness. Physicians will need to understand the long term medical needs, implications and complications of the disorder for the patient as well as the family.
Specific domain objectives:
•	Describe the clinical features and explain the management strategies of chronic medical conditions seen in children such as: 
Seasonal allergies, asthma, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, malignancy (e.g. acute lymphocytic leukemia or Wilms tumor), sickle cell disease, epilepsy, atopic dermatitis, obesity, sensory impairment, HIV/AIDS 
•	Perform a medical interview and a physical examination in a child with a chronic illness that includes the
o	effects of the chronic illness on growth and development,
o	emotional, economic and psychosocial functioning of the patient and family
o	treatments used, including "complementary and alternative therapies.”
•	Describe how chronic illness can influence a child's growth and development, educational achievement, and psychosocial functioning. 
•	Describe the impact that chronic illness has on the family's emotional, economic and psychosocial functioning. 
•	Describe the impact of a patient's culture on the understanding, reaction to, and management of a chronic illness.
•	Describe the contributions of each member of a multidisciplinary health care team in caring for children with a chronic illness.

While you have met the clerkship expectations of logging ONE patient with this domain, please consider logging additional patients as needed until you feel you have mastered the objectives for this domain. 
For remaining domains, please remember that CLIPP cases may be used to substitute an encounter with a patient if needed.
