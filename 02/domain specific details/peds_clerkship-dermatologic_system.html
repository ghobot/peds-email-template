Why is this important?
Rashes are common in pediatric patients. The ability to generate a differential diagnosis and formulate an assessment and plan for a patient presenting with a rash , taking into consideration the characteristics of the patient (i.e. age), the rash, and associated signs and symptoms, is essential to pediatric practice.  
Specific domain objectives:
•	Obtain a focused history and physical exam and generate a differential diagnosis for a patients presenting with a rash.
•	Describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management for each of the following diagnoses:
Viral rash (e.g. roseola, measles, coxsackie), scarlet fever, eczema, urticaria, contact dermatitis, thrush, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, acne, molluscum contagiosum, tinea corporis
While you have met the clerkship expectations of logging ONE patient with this domain, please consider logging additional patients as needed until you feel you have mastered the objectives for this domain. 
For remaining domains, please remember that CLIPP cases may be used to substitute an encounter with a patient if needed
