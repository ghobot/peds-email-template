behavior
Why is this important?
Providing anticipatory guidance especially in the areas of normative or expected behaviors and identification of abnormal behavior is critical to pediatric practice. Knowledge of age-appropriate behavior allows the physician to recognize deviant behaviors and facilitates earlier intervention.
Specific domain objectives:
•	Identify normal pattern of behaviors in the developing child such as: 
o	newborn infants: development and evolution of social skills
o	toddler: autonomy
o	school age: independence
o	adolescence: abstract thinking
•	Describe the typical presentation of common behavioral problems and issues in different age groups such as: 
o	Newborn/infants: sleep problems, colic
o	toddler: temper tantrums, toilet training, feeding problems
o	school age: enuresis, attention deficit, encopresis, autism
o	adolescence: eating disorders, risk-taking behavior, conduct disorders
•	Describe the emotional disturbances or medical conditions that may manifest as alterations in school performance and peer or family relationships.
•	Distinguish between age-appropriate behavior, inappropriate or abnormal behavior, and those that suggest severe psychiatric or development illness in children of different ages (for example head banging, threatening gestures, suicidal)
•	Describe how somatic complaints may represent psychosocial problems (e.g. recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, and neurologic complaints
•	Describe the types of situations where pathology in the family (e.g. alcoholism, domestic violence, depression) contributes to childhood behavior problems
•	Identify behavioral and psychosocial problems of childhood using the medical history and physical examination. 
•	Counsel parents and children about the management of common behavioral concerns such as discipline, toilet training, and eating disorders.
