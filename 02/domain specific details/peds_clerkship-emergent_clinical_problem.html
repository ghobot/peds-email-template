Emergent Clinical Problem
Why is this important?
All health care providers must be able to identify the infant, child, or adolescent with a medical emergency. A systemic and thorough approach to the seriously ill child may significantly reduce morbidity and mortality.
Specific domain objectives:
List the symptoms of and describe the initial emergency management of shock, respiratory distress, lethargy, apnea, and status epilepticus in pediatric patients. (CP)
Describe the age-appropriate differential diagnosis and the key clinical findings that would suggest a diagnosis for each of the emergent clinical problems in the table below.
Describe the clinical findings for each of the diagnosis to consider in the table below.
•	Describe the age-appropriate differential diagnosis and the key clinical findings that would suggest a diagnosis for each of the emergent clinical problems:  
Respiratory distress, shock, ataxia, seizures, airway obstruction, apnea, proptosis, suicidal ideation, trauma, cyanosis.
•	List the symptoms of and describe the initial emergency management of a patient presenting with each of the following:
Meningitis, shock, testicular torsion, DKA, SIDS, acute life threatening event (ALTE), congestive heart failure, burns, status asthmaticus, status epilepticus, encephalitis, child abuse 
While you have met the clerkship expectations of logging ONE patient with this domain, please consider logging additional patients as needed until you feel you have mastered the objectives for this domain. 
For remaining domains, please remember that CLIPP cases may be used to substitute an encounter with a patient if needed.
