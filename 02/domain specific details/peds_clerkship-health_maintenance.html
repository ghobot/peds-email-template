Health Maintenance
•	Newborn (0-1 month)
•	Infant (1-12 months)
•	Toddler (12-60 months)
•	School aged (5-12 years)
•	Adolescent (13-19 years)

Why is this important?
Health supervision, which includes assessment of growth and development, prevention of disease by immunization, prevention of injury by education, screening for treatable conditions and promotion of a healthy environment and a healthy lifestyle, is essential to pediatric practice and primary care. Prevention strategies are particularly important. Immunizations have resulted in a drastic reduction in the rates of certain infectious diseases. Injuries cause the majority of deaths in childhood and adolescence. Illness and injury prevention must be a prominent and recurrent theme during health maintenance and other health care visits. (Growth and development are the focus of other domains.)
Specific domain objectives
•	Describe the components of a health supervision visit including health promotion and disease and injury prevention, the appropriate use of screening tools, and immunizations for newborns, infants, toddlers, school aged children, and adolescents. 
•	Describe the rationale for childhood immunizations and the immunizations currently recommended from birth through adolescence and identify patients whose immunizations are delayed, using a standard reference of the currently recommended childhood vaccine schedule.
•	Discuss the rational, indications, appropriate use, interpretation, and limitations of common screening tests such as environmental lead questionnaire, domestic violence screening, CBC, blood lead level, and PPD/Quantiferon tests for tuberculosis. 
•	Define anticipatory guidance and describe how it changes based on the age of child. 
•	List the most common preventable morbidities in childhood and describe strategies for prevention. 
•	Perform an age-appropriate history and physical examination including a medical, psychosocial, language, physical maturation, and motor development assessment relevant to a health supervision visit using appropriate resources (e.g. Bellevue clinic templates, Bright Futures, the Denver Developmental Standard Test 2, MCHAT and HEADSS).
•	Demonstrate an ability to provide age-appropriate anticipatory guidance about nutrition, behavior, immunizations, injury prevention, pubertal development, sexuality, and substance use and abuse.
