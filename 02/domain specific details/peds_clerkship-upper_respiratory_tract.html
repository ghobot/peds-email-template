upper respiratory tract
Why is this important?
Upper respiratory symptoms are common presenting complaints in pediatric patients. The ability to generate a differential diagnosis and formulate an assessment and plan for a patient presenting with upper respiratory symptoms, taking into consideration the characteristics of the patient (i.e. age) and the illness, is essential to pediatric practice.  
Specific domain objectives:
•	Obtain a focused history and physical exam and generate a differential diagnosis for a patients presenting with each of the following symptoms:  
Sore throat, difficulty swallowing, otalgia
•	Describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management for each of the following diagnoses:
Pharyngitis, strep throat, viral URI, herpangina, peritonsillar abscess, allergic rhinitis, otitis media, sinusitis, otitis externa
Moving forward: 
While you have met the clerkship expectations of encountering ONE patient with this domain, please consider logging additional patients as needed until you feel you have mastered the objectives for this domain. 
For remaining domains, please remember that CLIPP cases may be used to substitute an encounter with a patient if needed.
